# Review Rollup (RevUp)
**Review Rollup (RevUp)** is a blockchain built with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli).
You can find the automatic installation script at the end for the setup.

## Get started

**Review Rollup (RevUp)** is a decentralized application (dApp) running on the Blockspacerace, a testnet network for Celestia, which allows users to submit their opinions on specific products, rate them, and view the comments made by others. You can use the ready-to-use setup script or follow the manual installation steps to get started.

### Details

After the installation process, you can use the following commands to use the application.

```
revupd tx revup create-review product rate user_comment --from revup-key --keyring-backend test
```

Let's examine in-depth:

You can specify the product name with the ```product``` parameter.
```rate``` indicates the score you will give to the product. You can rate it between 1 and 5.
The ```user_comment``` parameter contains your detailed comment about the product. You can write your comment inside double quotes.


To view the recorded comments on the chain, you can use the following command.

```
revupd query revup comments
```

### Web UI

With a Web UI , you can allow users to add comments to the chain and view the comments. For this, I have prepared a simple panel using Flask, and it looks like this.

Using the example UI, you can do the following:

- You can predefine the products users will comment on.

- You can limit the duration users can make comments and prevent congestion on the network.

- You can determine the comment scoring and allow the user to give a score between 1 and 5.

- You can view previously made comments with a single click.


### What you can do is limited only by your imagination!


### Install

You can follow these steps for the installation. Since it is an automatic script, with a few clicks, the rollup will be ready.

For RevUp to work, you need to have a synchronized testnet node. Don't forget that you need to have enough test TIA in your wallet. Otherwise, RevUp will not work. The default gas price is 6000utia.


``` 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuweltgeld/revup/main/install_script.sh && bash install_script.sh 
```

If wget is not installed, you can install it with the following command.

```
apt install wget
```
